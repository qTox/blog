Version 1.17.6 has been released. This release addresses a security issue for
Windows users. When installing to non-default locations, qTox now ensures that
the install directory permissions are restricted.

v1.18.0 is getting close and will have new features and many more fixes, but we
wanted to get this security fix out as soon as possible.

# Features and fixes
- Restrict Windows install directory permissions to not be writeable by regular users.
- Add a setting for showing group join/leave messages, off by default.
